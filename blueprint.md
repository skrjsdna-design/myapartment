# Blueprint: My Apartment

## Overview
"My Apartment" is a modern, framework-less web application designed to provide a unique and interactive user experience. It leverages modern web standards (Web Components, Container Queries, `:has()` selector, etc.) to ensure high performance and maintainability.

## Project Details
- **Architecture:** Framework-less (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **Core Technologies:** Web Components, ES Modules, Modern CSS (Baseline).
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS with modern features like Container Queries and Cascade Layers.
- **Interactivity:** Focus on expressive UI components and interactive feedback.

## Project History & Implementation Details
- Initial project structure with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.
- Git remote configured to `https://github.com/skrjsdna-design/myapartment.git`.
- Implemented 4-question MBTI quiz with multi-language support (EN, KO, JA, ES).
- Center-aligned quiz UI for better visual balance.

## Current Task: Layout Polishing & Content Enrichment
- **Objective:** Create a perfectly symmetrical, clean layout and enrich the content with detailed MBTI descriptions and a more professional landing page.
- **Plan:**
  1. **Landing Page Enhancement:** Add a Hero section and a Footer to `index.html`.
  2. **Visual Polishing:** Refine `style.css` with better spacing, typography (Plus Jakarta Sans), and subtle background textures.
  3. **Content Enrichment:** Expand `main.js` to include 8 questions (2 per dimension) and detailed descriptions for all 16 personality types.
  4. **Symmetry Check:** Ensure all elements are perfectly centered and balanced across the viewport.
  5. **Commit and push the changes.**
