# Blueprint: My Apartment

## Overview
"My Apartment" is a modern, framework-less web application designed to provide a unique and interactive user experience. It leverages modern web standards (Web Components, Container Queries, `:has()` selector, etc.) to ensure high performance and maintainability.

## Project Details
- **Architecture:** Framework-less (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **Core Technologies:** Web Components, ES Modules, Modern CSS (Baseline).
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS with modern features like Container Queries and Cascade Layers.
- **Interactivity:** Focus on expressive UI components and interactive feedback.

## Project History & Implementation Details
- Initial project structure with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.
- Git remote configured to `https://github.com/skrjsdna-design/myapartment.git`.
- Implemented 4-question MBTI quiz with multi-language support (EN, KO, JA, ES).

## Current Task: UI Alignment & Polishing
- **Objective:** Center-align the quiz question and answer UI for better visual balance.
- **Plan:**
  1. Update `main.js` styles to center-align `h2` and `button` elements.
  2. Adjust button layout to maintain aesthetics while centered.
  3. Commit and push the changes.
